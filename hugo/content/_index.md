### About me
I am currently a model engineer for Ghost living in Seattle, WA. Previously I built advertising indexes for Microsoft Bing and  was a quantitative researcher for Citadel Securities. My work is at the intersection of mathematical models and performance optimized code. You can find me on Twitter [@dan_schm1dt](https://twitter.com/dan_schm1dt)
